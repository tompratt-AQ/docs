# Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework
The following articles describe application compatibility issues in recent versions of the .NET Framework:  
  
-   Between versions 4 and 4.5: [Application Compatibility in 4.5](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-5.md)  
  
-   Between versions 4.5 and 4.5.1: [Application Compatibility in 4.5.1](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-5-1.md)  
  
-   Between versions 4.5.1 and 4.5.2: [Application Compatibility in 4.5.2](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-5-2.md)  
  
-   Between versions 4.5.2 and 4.6: [Application Compatibility in 4.6](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-6.md)  
  
-   Between versions 4.6 and the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]: [Application Compatibility in 4.6.1](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)  
  
-   Between versions 4.6.1 and the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)]: [Application Compatibility in 4.6.2](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-6-2.md)  

- Between versions 4.6.2 and the .NET Framework 4.7: [Application Compatibility in 4.7](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)  

In general, we have attempted to maintain a very high level of backward compatibility between versions of the .NET Framework, so that apps that target a specific version will run without modification on later versions. Most application compatibility issues have low impact, and most do not require programming modifications to your apps. For those that require modification, see the Impact column of the tables in these links.  
  
## Migrating from versions before the .NET Framework 4
  
 If you are migrating from a version of the .NET Framework before the .NET Framework 4, review the following topics for application compatibility issues that may affect your app:
