# .NET Compatibility Diagnostics
The .NET Compatibility Diagnostics are Roslyn-powered analyzers that help identify application compatibility issues between versions of the .NET Framework. This list contains all of the analyzers available, although only a subset will apply to any specific migration. The analyzers will determine which issues are applicable for the planned migration and will only surface those. For issues split up by versions impacted, please see: [Application Compatibility](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility.md).  
  
 Each issue includes the following information:  
  
-   The description of what has changed from a previous version.  
  
-   The suggestion is a description of how the change affects customers and whether any workarounds are available to preserve compatibility across versions.  
  
-   An assessment of how important the change is. Application compatibility issue are categorized as follows:  
  
    |||  
    |-|-|  
    |Major|A significant change that affects a large number of apps or requires substantial modification of code.|  
    |Minor|A change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.|  
    |Edge case|A change that affects apps under very specific, uncommon scenarios.|  
    |Transparent|A change with no noticeable effect on the application’s developer or user.|  
  
-   Version indicates when the change first appears in the framework. Some of the changes are reverted and that is indicated as well.  
  
-   The type of change:  
  
    |||  
    |-|-|  
    |Retargeting|The change affects apps that are recompiled to target a new version of the .NET Framework.|  
    |Runtime|The change affects an existing app that targets a previous version of the .NET Framework but runs on a later version.|  
  
-   The affected APIS, if any.  
  
-   The IDs of the available diagnostics

## 1: SoapFormatter cannot deserialize Hashtable and similar ordered collection objects  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|The SoapFormatter does not guarantee that objects serialized under one .NET Framework version will successfully deserialize under a different version. Specifically, some ordered collections (like Hashtable) added members between 4.0 and 4.5 such that objects of these types cannot deserialize with .NET 4.0 if they were serialzied with .NET 4.5. Note that if the serialized data is both serialized and deserialized with the same .NET Framework version, no issue will occur.|  
|Suggestion|SoapFormatter serialization should be replaced with BinaryFormatter serialization or NetDataContractSerialization to be resilient to .NET Framework changes.|

## 3: WPF DataTemplate elements are now visible to UIA  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Previously, DataTemplate elements were invisible to UI Automation. Beginning in 4.5, UI Automation will detect these elements. This is useful in many cases, but can break tests that depend on UIA trees not containing DataTemplate elements.|  
|Suggestion|UI Auomation tests for this app may need updated to account for the UIA tree now including previously invisible DataTemplate elements. For example, tests that expect some elements to be next to each other may now need to expect previously invisible UIA elements in between. Or tests that rely on certain counts or indexes for UIA elements may need updated with new values.|

## 4: WPF TextBox selected text appears a different color when the text box is inactive  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|In .NET 4.5, when a WPF text box control is inactive (it doesn't have focus), the selected text inside the box will appear a different color than when the control is active.|  
|Suggestion|Previous (.NET 4.0) behavior may be restored by setting the [FrameworkCompatibilityPreferences.AreInactiveSelectionHighlightBrushKeysSupported](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.frameworkcompatibilitypreferences.areinactiveselectionhighlightbrushkeyssupported\(v=vs.110\).aspx) property to false.|

## 5: List\<T>.ForEach can throw exception when modifying list item  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Beginning in .NET 4.5, a `List<T>.ForEach` enumerator will throw an InvalidOperationException exception if an element in the calling collection is modified. Previously, this would not throw an exception but could lead to race conditions.|  
|Suggestion|Ideally, code should be fixed to not modify lists while enumerating their elements because that is never a safe operation. To revert to the previous behavior, though, an app may target .NET 4.0.|

## 6: System.Uri parsing adheres to RFC 3987  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|URI parsing has changed in several ways in .NET 4.5. Note, however, that these changes only affect code targeting .NET 4.5. If a binary targets .NET 4.0, the old behavior will be observed. Changes to URI parsing in .NET 4.5 include:<br /><br /> URI parsing will perform normalization and character checking according to the latest IRI rules in RFC 3987<br /><br /> Unicode normalization form C will only be performed on the host portion of the URI<br /><br /> Invalid mailto: URIs will now cause an exception<br /><br /> Trailing dots at the end of a path segment are now preserved<br /><br /> `file://` URIs do not escape the `?` character<br /><br /> Unicode control characters `U+0080` through `U+009F` are not supported<br /><br /> Comma characters `,` or `%2c` are not automatically unescaped|  
|Suggestion|If the old .NET 4.0 URI parsing semantics are necessary (they often aren't), they can be used by targeting .NET 4.0. This can be accomplished by using a TargetFrameworkAttribute on the assembly, or through Visual Studio's project system UI in the 'project properties' page.|

## 10: System.Uri escaping now supports RFC 3986 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|URI escaping has changed in .NET 4.5 to support [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). Specific changes include:<br /><br /> `EscapeDataString` escapes reserved characters based on RFC 3986.<br /><br /> `EscapeUriString` does not escape reserved characters.<br /><br /> `UnescapeDataString` does not throw an exception if it encounters an invalid escape sequence.<br /><br /> Unreserved escaped characters are un-escaped.|  
|Suggestion|Update applications to not rely on UnescapeDataString to throw in the case of an invalid escape sequence. Such sequences must be detected directly now.<br /><br /> Similarly, expect that Escaped and Unescaped URI and Data strings may vary from .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5 and should not be compared across .NET versions directly. Instead, they should be parsed and normalized in a single .NET version before any comparisons are made.|

## 12: MEF catalogs implement IEnumerable and therefore can no longer be used to create a serializer  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5, MEF catalogs implement IEnumerable and therefore can no longer be used to create a serializer (XmlSerializer object). Trying to serialize a MEF catalog throws an exception.|

## 13: Missing Target Framework Moniker results in 4.0 behavior  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Applications without a [TargetFrameworkAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.versioning.targetframeworkattribute\(v=vs.110\).aspx) applied at the assembly level will automatically run using the semantics (quirks) of the .NET Framework 4.0. To ensure high quality, it is recommended that all binaries be explicitly attributed with a TargetFrameworkAttribute indicating the version of the .NET Framework they were built with. Note that using a target framework moniker in a project file will caues MSBuild to automatically apply a TargetFrameworkAttribute.|  
|Suggestion|A [target framework attribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.versioning.targetframeworkattribute\(v=vs.110\).aspx) should be supplied, either through adding the attribute directly to the assembly or by specifying a target framework in the [project file or through Visual Studio's project properties GUI](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/05/19/visual-studio-managed-multi-targeting-part-1-concepts-target-framework-moniker-target-framework.aspx).|

## 14: No longer able to set EnableViewStateMac to false  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|ASP.NET no longer allows developers to specify `<pages enableViewStateMac="false"/>` or `<@Page EnableViewStateMac="false" %>`. The view state message authentication code (MAC) is now enforced for all requests with embedded view state. Only apps that explicitly set the EnableViewStateMac property to false are affected.|  
|Suggestion|EnableViewStateMac must be assumed to be true, and any resulting MAC errors must be resolved (as explained in [this](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2915218) guidance, which contains multiple resolutions depending on the specifics of what is causing MAC errors).|

## 18: BlockingCollection\<T>.TryTakeFromAny does not throw anymore  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|If one of the input collections is marked completed, `BlockingCollection<T>.TryTakeFromAny(BlockingCollection<T>[], T)` no longer returns -1 and `BlockingCollection<T>.TakeFromAny` no longer throws an exception. This change makes it possible to work with collections when one of the collections is either empty or completed, but the other collection still has items that can be retrieved.|  
|Suggestion|If TryTakeFromAny returning -1 or TakeFromAny throwing were used for control-flow purposes in cases of a blocking collection being completed, such code should now be changed to use `.Any(b => b.IsCompleted)` to detect that condition.|

|-|-|  
|Details|If the LoadOptions.SetLineInfo value is passed to the Load method and a validation error occurs, the XmlSchemaException.LineNumber and XmlSchemaException.LinePosition properties now contain line information.|

## 23: New (ambiguous) Dispatcher.Invoke overloads could result in different behavior  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|The .NET Framework 4.5 adds new overloads to Dispatcher.Invoke that include a parameter of type System.Action. When existing code is recompiled, compilers may resolve calls to Dispatcher.Invoke methods that have a Delegate parameter as calls to Dispatcher.Invoke methods with an System.Action parameter. If a call to a Dispatcher.Invoke overload with a Delegate parameter is resolved as a call to a Dispatcher.Invoke overload with an System.Action parameter, the following differences in behavior may occur:<br /><br /> If an exception occurs, the Dispatcher.UnhandledExceptionFilter and Dispatcher.UnhandledException events are not raised. Instead, exceptions are handled by the UnobservedTaskException event.<br /><br /> Calls to some members, such as DispatcherOperation.Result, block until the operation has completed.|  
|Suggestion|To avoid ambiguity (and potential differences in exception handling or blocking behaviors), code calling Dispatcher.Invoke can pass an empty object[] as a second parameter to the Invoke call to be sure of resolving to the .NET 4.0 method overload.|

|Details|The `EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, Int32, Int32)` constructor is obsolete now and will introduce build warnings if used.|  
|Suggestion|Although the `EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, Int32, Int32)` constructor will continue to work, the following constructor should be used instead to avoid the obsolete build warning when re-compiling code with .NET 4.5 tools: [EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, EncoderParameterValueType, IntPtr)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh875096\(v=vs.110\).aspx).|

## 26: Change in behavior for Task.WaitAll methods with time-out arguments  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Task.WaitAll behavior was made more consistent in .NET 4.5.<br /><br /> In the .NET Framework 4, these methods behaved inconsistently. When the time-out expired, if one or more tasks were completed or canceled before the method call, the method threw an AggregateException exception. When the time-out expired, if no tasks were completed or canceled before the method call, but one or more tasks entered these states after the method call, the method returned false.<br />In the .NET Framework 4.5, these method overloads now return false if any tasks are still running when the time-out interval expired, and they throw an AggregateException exception only if an input task was cancelled (regardless of whether it was before or after the method call) and no other tasks are still running.|  
|Suggestion|If an AggregateException was being caught as a means of detecting a task that was cancelled prior to the WaitAll call being invoked, that code should instead do the same detection via the IsCanceled property (for example: .Any(t => t.IsCanceled)) since .NET 4.6 will only throw in that case if all awaited tasks are completed prior to the timeout.|

## 27: Change in behavior in Data Definition Language (DDL) APIs  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|The behavior of DDL APIs when AttachDBFilename is specified has changed as follows:<br /><br /> Connection strings need not specify an Initial Catalog value. Previously, both AttatchDBFilename and Initial Catalog were required.<br /><br /> If both AttatchDBFilename and Initial Catalog are specified and the given MDF file exists, the ObjectContext.DatabaseExists method returns true. Previously, it returned false.<br /><br /> If both AttatchDBFilename and Initial Catalog are specified and the given MDF file exists, calling the ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase method deletes the files.<br /><br /> If ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase is called when the connection string specifies an AttachDBFilename value with an MDF that doesn't exist and an Initial Catalog that doesn't exist, the method throws an InvalidOperationException exception. Previously, it threw a SqlException exception.|  
|Suggestion|These changes make it easier to build tools and applications that use the DDL APIs. These changes can affect application compatibility in the following scenarios:<br /><br /> The user writes code that executes a DROP DATABASE command directly instead of calling ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase if ObjectContext.DatabaseExists returns true. This breaks existing code If the database is not attached but the MDF file exists.<br /><br /> The user writes code that expects the ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase method to throw a SqlException exception rather than an InvalidOperationException exception when the Initial Catalog and MDF file don't exist.|

## 38: WPF DispatcherSynchronizationContext.CreateCopy now returns a new copy instead of the current instance  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|In the .NET Framework 4, DispatcherSynchronizationContext.CreateCopy() returned a reference to the current instance, primarily as a performance optimization. In the .NET Framework 4.5, it returns a new instance which makes it possible for the first time to conclude that equal references indicate the executing thread is in the correct synchronization context.  It is unlikely that code that checks the identity of these references will be affected, but because of the change, code that calls DispatcherSynchronizationContext.CreateCopy should be tested as part of migration to the .NET Framework 4.5 or newer.|  
|Suggestion|Be aware that DispatcherSynchronizationContext.CreateCopy() will now return a new SynchronizationContext object.  Previously, code that used equivalence of references generated this way was not actually checking whether it was in the proper context, but does when built against .NET 4.5 or newer.  While unlikely to cause issues, exercising the affected code paths should be enough to determine if this poses any problem.|

For example, a method can return a cached task to represent an already completed operation instead of allocating a new task. This was impossible in previous .NET Framework versions, because any consumer of the task could dispose of it, which rendered it unusable.|  
|Suggestion|Be aware that Task methods may no longer throw ObjectDisposedExceptions in cases when the object is disposed. If an app was depending on this exception to know that a task was disposed, it should be updated to explicitly check the task's status using [Task.Status](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.threading.tasks.task.status\(v=vs.110\).aspx).|

|Suggestion|Because the previous behavior was non-deterministic, code is unlikely to depend on it.

## 55: Exceptions during unobserved processing in System.Threading.Tasks.Task no longer propagate on finalizer thread  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Because the System.Threading.Tasks.Task class represents an asynchronous operation, it catches all non-severe exceptions that occur during asynchronous processing. In the .NET Framework 4.5, if an exception is not observed and your code never waits on the task, the exception will no longer propagate on the finalizer thread and crash the process during garbage collection. This change enhances the reliability of applications that use the Task class to perform unobserved asynchronous processing.|  
|Suggestion|If an app depends on unobserved asynchronous exceptions propagating to the finalizer thread, the previous behavior can be restored by providing an appropriate handler for the [TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.unobservedtaskexception\(v=vs.110\).aspx) event, or by setting a [runtime configuration element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj160346%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).|

## 59: Log file name created by the ObjectContext.CreateDatabase method has changed to match SQL Server specifications  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|When the CreateDatabase method is called either directly or by using Code First with the SqlClient provider and an AttachDBFilename value in the connection string, it creates a log file named filename_log.ldf instead of filename.ldf (where filename is the name of the file specified by the AttachDBFilename value). This change improves debugging by providing a log file named according to SQL Server specifications.|  
|Suggestion|If the log file name is important for an app, the app should be updated to expect the standard _log.ldf file name format.|

## 60: Page.LoadComplete event no longer causes System.Web.UI.WebControls.EntityDataSource control to invoke data binding  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|The `Page.LoadComplete` event no longer causes the System.Web.UI.WebControls.EntityDataSource control to invoke data binding for changes to create/update/delete parameters. This change eliminates an extraneous trip to the database, prevents the values of controls from being reset, and produces behavior that is consistent with other data controls, such as SqlDataSource and ObjectDataSource. This change produces different behavior in the unlikely event that applications rely on invoking data binding in the `Page.LoadComplete` event.|

## 63: Apps published with ClickOnce that use a SHA-256 code-signing certificate may fail on Windows 2003  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|The executable is signed with SHA256. Previously, it was signed with SHA1 regardless of whether the code-signing certificate was SHA-1 or SHA-256. This applies to:<br /><br /> All applications built with Visual Studio 2012 or later.<br /><br /> Applications built with Visual Studio 2010 or earlier on systems with the .NET Framework 4.5 present.<br /><br /> In addition, if the .NET Framework 4.5 or later is present, the ClickOnce manifest is also signed with SHA-256 for SHA-256 certificates regardless of the .NET Framework version against which it was compiled.|  
|Suggestion|The change in signing the ClickOnce executable affects only Windows Server 2003 systems; they require that KB 938397 be installed.<br /><br /> The change in signing the manifest with SHA-256 even when an app targets the .NET Framework 4.0 or earlier versions introduces a runtime dependency on the .NET Framework 4.5 or a later version.|

|||

|Details|For apps that target the .NET Framework 4 or that run on the .NET Framework 4.5.1 or earlier versions, DataObject.GetData retrieves HTML-formatted data as an ASCII string. As a result, non-ASCII characters (characters whose ASCII codes are greater than 0x7F) are represented by two random characters.<br /><br /> For apps that target the .NET Framework 4.5 or later and run on the .NET Framework 4.5.2, `DataObject.GetData` retrieves HTML-formatted data as UTF-8, which represents characters greater than 0x7F correctly.|  
|Suggestion|If you implemented a workaround for the encoding problem with HTML-formatted strings (for example, by explicitly encoding the HTML string retrieved from the Clipboard by passing it to the UTF8Encoding.GetString method) and you're retargeting your app from version 4 to 4.5, that workaround should be removed.<br /><br /> If the old behavior is needed for some reason, the app can target the .NET Framework 4.0 to get that behavior.|

## 78: ContentDisposition DateTimes returns slightly different string  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|String representations of ContentDispositions have been updated, beginning in 4.6, to always represent the hour component of a DateTime with two digits. This is to comply with [RFC822](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt) and [RFC2822](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt). This causes `ContentDisposition.ToString` to return a slightly different string in 4.6 in scenarios where one of the disposition's time elements was before 10:00 AM. Note that ContentDispositions are sometimes serialized via converting them to strings, so any ContentDisposition ToString operations, serialization, or GetHashCode calls should be reviewed.|  
|Suggestion|Do not expect that string representations of ContentDispositions from different .NET Framework versions will correctly compare to one another. Convert the strings back to ContentDispositions, if possible, before conducting a comparison.|

If the Service Flags value has the `0x20000` bit set, the provider uses IFS handles and will work correctly. If the `0x20000` bit is clear (not set), it is a non-IFS BSP or LSP.|

## 100: Foreach iterator variable is now scoped within the iteration, so closure capturing semantics are different (in C#5)  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Beginning with C# 5 (Visual Studio 2012), foreach iterator variables are scoped within the iteration. This can cause breaks if code was previously depending on the variables to not be included in the foreach's closure. The symptom of this change will be that an iterator variable passed to a delagate will be treated as the value it had at the time the delegate was created, rather than the value it had at the time the delegate was invoked.|  
|Suggestion|Ideally, code should be updated to expect the new compiler behavior. If the old semantics are required, the iterator variable can be replaced with a separate variable which is explicitly placed outside of the loop's scope.|

## 101: HtmlTextWriter does not render \`<br/\>` element correctly  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6, calling `HtmlTextWriter.RenderBeginTag()` and `HtmlTextWriter.RenderEndTag()` with a `<BR />` element will correctly insert only one `<BR />` (instead of two)|  
|Suggestion|If an app depended on the extra `<BR />` tag, `HtmlTextWriter.RenderBeginTag()` should be called a second time. Note that this behavior change only affects apps that are targeting the .NET Framework 4.6, so another option is to target a previous version of the .NET Framework in order to get the old behavior.|

## 104: Calling Items.Refresh on a WPF ListBox, ListView, or DataGrid with items selected can cause duplicate items to appear in the element  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|In the .NET Framework 4.5, calling ListBox.Items.Refresh from code while items are selected in a ListBox can cause the selected items to be duplicated in the list. A similar issue occurs with ListView and DataGrid. This is fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6.|  
|Suggestion|This issue may be worked around by programatically unselecting items before Refresh is called and then re-selecting them after the call is completed. Alternatively, this issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6 and may be addressed by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework.|

In the .NET Framework 4.5, the TPL provider began providing explicit keywords and triggered this issue. In the .NET Framework 4.6, EventListeners have been updated to no longer have this issue.|  
|Suggestion|To work around this problem, replace calls to EnableEvents(eventSource, level) with calls to the EnableEvents overload that explicitly specifies the "any keywords" mask to use: `EnableEvents(eventSource, level, unchecked((EventKeywords)0xFFFFffffFFFFffff))`.<br /><br /> Alternatively, this issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6 and may be addressed by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework.|

## 109: Building an Entity Framework edmx with Visual Studio 2013 can fail with error MSB4062 if using the EntityDeploySplit or EntityClean tasks  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|MSBuild 12.0 tools (included in Visual Studio 2013) changed msbuild file locations, causing older Entity Framework targets files to be invalid. The result is that `EntityDeploySplit` and `EntityClean` tasks fail because they are unable to find `Microsoft.Data.Entity.Build.Tasks.dll`. Note that this break is because of a toolset (msbuild/VS) change, not because of a .NET Framework change. It will only occur when upgrading developer tools, not when merely upgrading the .NET Framework.|  
|Suggestion|Entity Framework targets files are fixed to work with the new msbuild layout beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6. Upgrading to that version of the Framework will fix this issue. Alternatively, [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24249247/131944) workaround can be used to patch the targets files directly.|

## 111: XSD Schema validation now correctly detects violations of unique constraints if compound keys are used and one key is empty

|-|-|  
|Details|Versions of the .NET Framework prior to 4.6 had a bug that caused XSD validation to not detect unique constraints on compound keys if one of the keys was empty. In the .NET Framework 4.6, this issue is corrected. This will result in more correct validation, but it may also result in some XML not validating which previously would have.|  
|Suggestion|If looser, .NET Framework 4.0 validation is needed, the validating application can target version 4.5 (or earlier) of the .NET Framework. When retargeting to .NET 4.6, however, code review should be done to be sure that duplicate compound keys (as described in this issue's description) are not expected to validate.|

|Details|Prior to the .NET Framework 4.6, calling `GetCustomAttribute(s)` on an indexer property which differed from another property only by the type of the index would result in an `AmbiguousMatchException`. Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6, the property's attributes will be correctly returned.|

## 113: Intermittently unable to scroll to bottom item in ItemsControls (like ListBox and DataGrid) when using custom DataTemplates

|Suggestion|This issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and may be addressed by upgrading to that version (or a later version) of the .NET Framework.

|Details|Improvements were made to GlyphRun.ComputeInkBoundingBox() and FormattedText.Extent in the .NET Framework 4.5 to address issues where the boxes were too small for the contained glyphs in some cases in the .NET Framework 4.0. As a result of this, some bounding boxes will be larger beginning in the .NET Framework 4.5, resulting in subtle differences in UI layout.|  
|Suggestion|Be aware that some glyph bounding box sizes have increased. These changes will usually improve presentation and hit box testing, but if the older (pre-.NET 4.5) behavior is desired, it can be opted into by adding the following entry to the app.config file:<br /><br /> `<appsettings> <add key="IncludeAllInkInBoundingBox" value="false"> </appsettings>`|

|Details|Due to internal changes to the type, `System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary` objects that are serialized with the .NET Framework 4.5 using the `NetDataContractSerializer` cannot be deserialized in the .NET Framework 4.5.1 or in the .NET Framework 4.5.2.<br /><br /> Note that moving the other direction (serializing with the .NET Framework 4.5.x and deserializing with the .NET Framework 4.5) works. Similarly, all 4.x cross-version serialization works with the .NET Framework 4.6.<br /><br /> Serializing and deserializing with a single version of the .NET Framework is not affected.|  
|Suggestion|If it is necessary to serialize and deserialize a ConcurrentDictionary between the .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Framework 4.5.1/4.5.2, an alternate serializer like the DataContractSerializer or BinaryFormatter serializer should be used instead of the NetDataContractSerializer.<br /><br /> Alternatively, because this issue is addressed in the .NET Framework 4.6, it may be solved by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework.|

## 141: WPF TreeViewItem must be used within a TreeView  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|A change was introduced in 4.5 that restricts usage of TreeViewItem elements outside of a TreeView. This manifests under the following conditions:<br /><br /> TreeViewItem's visual parent is not a panel. (A TreeViewItem generated for a TreeView will have a panel as its parent)<br /><br /> The TreeViewItem is a descendant of a VirtualizingStackPanel acting as the "items host" for a list control (ListBox, DataGrid, ListView, etc.). Virtualization doesn't need to be enabled.<br /><br /> The VirtualizingStackPanel is item-scrolling (`ScrollUnit="Item"`).<br /><br /> Someone calls `VirtualizingStackPanel.MakeVisible(v)` to scroll an element `v` into view. This can be done explicitly, or implicitly in a number of ways; perhaps the most common way is simply clicking on `v` to give it the keyboard focus.<br /><br /> The visual-parent chain from `v` to the VirtualizingStackPanel passes through the TreeViewItem.<br /><br /> In other words, this is seen when a TreeViewItem is used outside of a TreeView, and the user clicks on a descendant of the TreeViewItem to bring it into view. If the TreeViewItem has no focusable descendants, you'll never see this issue. An example of a situation where this is hit is when a TreeViewItem is the root of a DataTemplate.  When this issue is hit, there is an InvalidCastException that occurs within the WPF framework.|

## 145: CurrentCulture is not preserved across WPF Dispatcher operations  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Details|Beginning in the .NET Framework 4.6, changes to CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture made within a [Dispatcher](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.threading.dispatcher%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) will be lost at the end of that dispatcher operation. Similarly, changes to CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture made outside of a Dispatcher operation may not be reflected when that operation executes.<br /><br /> Practically speaking, this means that CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture changes may not flow between WPF UI callbacks and other code in a WPF application.<br /><br /> This is due to a change in [ExecutionContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.threading.executioncontext%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) that causes CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture to be stored in the execution context beginning with apps targeting the .NET Framework 4.6. WPF dispatcher operations store the execution context used to begin the operation and restore the previous context when the operation is completed. Because CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture are now part of that context, changes to them within a dispatcher operation are not persisted outside of the operation.|  
|Suggestion|Apps affected by this change may work around it by storing the desired CurrentCulture or CurrentUICulture in a field and checking in all Dispatcher operation bodies (including UI event callback handlers) that the correct CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture are set. Alternatively, because the ExecutionContext change underlying this WPF change only affects apps targeting the .NET Framework 4.6 or newer, this break can be avoided by targeting the .NET Framework 4.5.2.|
