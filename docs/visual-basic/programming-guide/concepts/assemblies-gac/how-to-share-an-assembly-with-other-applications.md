# How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)
Assemblies can be private or shared: by default, most simple programs consist of a private assembly because they are not intended to be used by other applications.  
  
 In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the [Global Assembly Cache](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cf5eacd0-d3ec-4879-b6da-5fd5e4372202) (GAC).  
  
### Sharing an assembly  
  
1.  Create your assembly. For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/54832ee9-dca8-4c8b-913c-c0b9d265e9a4).  
  
2.  Assign a strong name to your assembly. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2c30799a-a826-46b4-a25d-c584027a6c67).  
  
3.  Assign version information to your assembly. For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/51ket42z).  
  
4.  Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a7e6f091-d02c-49ba-b736-7295cb0eb743).  
  
5.  Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications. For more information, see [How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4c6a406a-b5eb-44fa-b4ed-4e95bb95a813).
